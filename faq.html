        <div class="about">
            <span class="title">What is Metacosm Studios?</span><br />
            We are an indie, not-for-profit, virtual film studio that produces movies, short films, and episodic series shot entirely in VRChat<br /><br /><br /><br />

            <span class="title">What is Into the Metaverse?</span><br />
            Into the Metaverse is an anime, action-adventure film that tells the story of Rikkaâ€™s journey into VRChat. Formerly known as VRChat The Movie, our indie film is a free 90-minute movie that will be released on YouTube. Into the Metaverse is planned to release Summer 2022.<br /><br /><br /><br />

            <span class="title">What is the Cinematic Metaverse?</span><br />
            The Cinematic Metaverse is a collection of films that take place in the same fictional universe and share a common lore. These films are developed in collaboration with our filmmakers.<br /><br /><br /><br />

            <span class="title">Where do you get the avatars you use in your films?</span><br />
            We make our avatars in-house, purchase avatars from Booth and Gumroad, and use avatars publicly available in VRChat avatar worlds.<br /><br /><br /><br />

            <span class="title">What software do you use for production?</span><br />
            We create assets with Blender and Unity, record with OBS and NVIDIA Shadowplay, and edit with Adobe Premiere and Vegas Pro.<br /><br /><br /><br />

            <span class="title">How can I support Metacosm Studios?</span><br />
            We are a community of volunteers and VRChat fans.

            <span class="title">Do you have any tutorials, workshops, or tips for beginning filmmakers?</span><br />
            We welcome filmmakers to apply and volunteer with current film projects to learn about directing, cinematography, and production. We plan to create educational content in the future.<br /><br /><br /><br />

            <span class="title">I have an idea for a film, how do I work with you?</span><br />
            We are currently focused on completing the projects announced as part of our Cinematic Metaverse. We do welcome new ideas for future consideration.<br /><br />
