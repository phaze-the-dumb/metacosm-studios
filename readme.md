### Current Todo

- Mobile Support (their current website doesn't support mobile either, but it works better than this one on mobile)
- Custom Video Player
- Meta Tags!!!!!

### Why Did I Make This?

I've been watching a few of metacosm studios films lately and I've also been wanting to learn `animejs` and `lenis` so I thought I'd do this! (also their current website is a wixsite and I felt sorry for them)

If on the offchance someone from metacosm studios is reading this and you want to use this as your website dm me `Phaze#6193` :>
